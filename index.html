                <h3>Green Sauce Pasta</h3>
                <p>Boil the pasta. Pop the spinach, cilantro, and parsley in a microwave-safe container . Sprinkle about
                    a tablespoon of water over the leaves, cover, and microwave.

                <h3>Spice Pasta</h3>
                <p>Cream and spice is such an underrated combo, especially in this context. The cream not only adds
                    richness, but also helps the spice not get too all up in your face.

                <h3>Chocolate Cake</h3>
                <p>The cake batter really can be made in a bowl without the use of a heavy duty mixer. Of course, that
                    just makes things easier, but this is easily a recipe enjoyed making.
